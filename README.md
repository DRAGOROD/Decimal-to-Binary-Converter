It is a simple web-based decimal to binary converter built using JavaScript recursion. It not only converts decimal numbers into binary but also visually demonstrates how recursion works through a call stack animation for a specific input.
The animation helps illustrate how recursive function calls are pushed to and popped from the call stack step by step.

**🧰 Toolkits Used**

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

**⚙️ Features**

Convert any non-negative decimal number to binary
Recursive conversion logic
Call stack visualization for input 5
Step-by-step animation of function calls
Input validation for incorrect or negative values
Keyboard support (press Enter to convert)
Responsive layout

**🔄 The Process**

Implemented a recursive function to convert decimal numbers to binary.
Created animation data representing recursive call steps.
Used setTimeout() to simulate call stack push, message update, and pop.
Added input validation and event listeners for button click and Enter key.

**📘 What I Learned**

How recursion works in practical scenarios
Visualizing the call stack concept in JavaScript
Managing timed UI updates using setTimeout()
Structuring animation logic with data objects
Handling DOM updates dynamically
Improving user interaction with validation and keyboard support

**🚀 Possible Improvements**

Animate call stack for any number, not just 5
Add step-by-step manual controls (Next / Previous)
Display recursion depth count
Improve animation timing control (speed slider)
Add explanation panel for each step
Dark/light theme toggle
Show binary calculation math visually
Add unit tests for conversion logic
